## Get Data
Getting data from any geospatial source is the first step of any geospatial project. But sometimes it became frustrating because we can see it as a service but we cannot get the raw data. So here are some easy to follow codes to get geospatial data.

### getarcgisfeature
We often see ArcGIS feature service but cannot get the data. So here is the code to make your life easier. You just have to find the ArcGIS FeatureService end point.

### getosm
getosm as the name suggests is getting osm data through Overpass API. The inline instruction is quite clear. To follow step by step, please use the ipynb. Don't forget to learn a bit on the key value pairs in https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features and how to write the Query Language in https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide
