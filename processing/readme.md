## Processing Geospatial Data
Sometimes I had difficult times using tools given in QGIS, and tired of it. So I better make my own simple code to run simple things. Feel free to use and modify any of these code.

### rastermask
Both rastermask.py and rastermask.ipynb were made to simply clip/mask a raster using any polygon because for some reasons QGIS didn't want to process my data. You can follow step by step using the ipynb.
